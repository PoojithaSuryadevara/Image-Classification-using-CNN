# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Image classification is a task of sorting and assigning an input image to an appropriate class in a fixed set of multiple class images. Whereas, image prediction refers to classifying an unlabeled image with a class name. This approach to Image classification and prediction make use of Deep convolutional neural networks. This project uses a large set of images taken from inatuarilst.org which is an online social network of people sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature, which consists of recorded observations of different species like plants, birds, fungi, amphibians etc.
